# WolfLoader

WolfLoader is a custom BakkesMod plugin designed to be used in Rocket League this will allow you to load custom car and replace the current car mesh (visually) with the custom car that has been selected 

WolfLoader is only allowed in Freeplay and Workshop maps in order to comply with Psyonix/BakkesMod TOS like how AlphaConsole is doing their custom cars 

The Plugin will come preinstalled with cars from the following platforms (Switch, Box, Station)

(Switch)
Muffin Gunship (Orange)
Muffin Gunship (Blue)
Calzone (Red)
Calzone (Green)

(Box)
Hogstick Truck 
Gears Car

(Station)
Tooth Truck

# How to Download WolfLoader and Install

If you would like to download WolfLoader for your BakkesMod installion head to the releases tab on Github (Right hand side of your screen) once there you should see a rar file, download it inside you'll
find the following content: the plugin itself (.dll) file and the car files inside customcars folder

Open up the .bat file this will automatically attempt to install the plugin to the bakkesmod folder and copy the customcars to rocket league folder in order to work (Make sure your rocket league is closed
beforehand)

Once the script says it has completed install you may close the command prompt window and launch Rocket League then press F2 for BakkesMod and head to the plugins tab you should see WolfLoader at the bottom
of the plugin list, head into Freeplay then go to WolfLoader select one of the cars in the list and you should see your current car mesh replaced with the custom car one Enjoy :)


Also don't upload these cars to Alphaconsole's own website Alphaconsole's custom car feature is locked behind patreon wall so by default they it would look like Alphaconsole is charging to use Psyonix Assests when they're free 

So i don't want anything bad to happen to Alphaconsole so please don't do that 

# Known Issues

They're a few known issues with the plugin that i'm aware of that i'll attempt to fix when i have the time this is a list of said things

There is a small chance (1%) your game may crash if you alt tab via freeplay when the BakkesMod window is open 

Hogstick Truck spikes don't stick to the Truck and float i believe this is cause there is something wrong with the material / spikes aren't stuck to the truck properly 
I've had to recreate the spikes as i couldn't get the original ones to attach to the truck no matter what i did

Some Cars will crash your game if you use a F-150 for example your game will crash when trying to replace the mesh with a custom one i believe this is cause they're different materials rather than a single one

I don't have a list of said cars that will crash the game with the meshes as they're too many cars to go through without some method of automating testing

If people fill out the github issues with a car that crashes, i'll make a google document with the list of cars that crash and work but that will take some time

# Credits and Name

Alot of people have helped me make this plugin a reality so i would like to give them credit where credit is due

spiritvod over on the gildor forums 

ArcadeGamer1929 for helping out on accessing the box cars from that console 

Soul, Emii pointed me in the right direction roughly when it came to coding

Baron Von helped me out when it came to getting the Muffin car a few years ago now

WolfLoader name comes from the character called Silver Wolf in Honkai Star Rail thats where i got the idea of the name for, i was considering like CustomCarLoader or ConsoleCars but i thought WolfLoader sounded cooler
